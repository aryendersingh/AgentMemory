This is a sample text file for testing the file memory system.

It contains multiple paragraphs to test chunking functionality.
The chunker should be able to split this content into multiple chunks
while respecting natural boundaries like paragraph breaks.

This paragraph discusses configuration options. The memory system
supports various configuration parameters including chunk size,
overlap, and chunking strategy. Users can customize these settings
based on their specific use case.

Finally, this is the last paragraph of the test file. It should be
included in the final chunk when the file is processed by the loader.
